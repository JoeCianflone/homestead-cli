# Homestead CLI

A small tool that I started in a video over at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1pCXTyNAl8. The idea is pretty simple: Homestead is easy, but I'm kinda lazy and I want to very create and spin up new sites right from my terminal. Should be pretty simple right?

In the video we created the first piece, we added the `NewSiteCommand` to edit and update both the `hosts` file and the `homestead.yaml` file. At this point, that's all we've got, but I'm going to tweak and make updates to this thing as I go along and we'll see where it goes from here.
